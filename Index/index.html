                <h3>Lisa Marie Simpson</h3>
                <p>She is a charismatic 8-year-old girl who exceeds the standard achievement of the intelligence level of children her age. Not to everyone's surprise, she is also the moral center of her family. In her upbringing, Lisa lacks parental involvement of Homer and Marge, which leads to hobbies such as playing saxophone and guitar, riding and caring for horses, and interest in advanced studies. In school, Lisa's popularity is affected by those who view her as a geeky overachiever, which leaves her with only a few friends. </p>

                <h3>Bartholomew JoJo Simpson</h3>
                <p>He is a notorious prankster at Springfield Elementary, and his pranks are often elaborately complex, but can lead to unfortunate consequences. Bart's overall intelligence, like his mother's, has been shown to fluctuate slightly over the course of the series. It has been shown anywhere from being just above his father's level, to being just below, or (on the rare occasion that he shows interest or is willing to pay attention) exceeding that of his sister. Despite his behavior, Bart is also extremely good at science, art and even sports like skateboarding</p>

                <h3>Homer Jay Simpson</h3>
                <p>He is a pure moron who can go back and forth from being downright horrible to an extremely caring and loving man. His personality is one of frequent immaturity, frequent stupidity, selfishness, laziness, and explosive anger. He also suffers from a short attention span, which complements his intense but short-lived passion for hobbies, enterprises, and various causes. Despite his flaws, he is a loving father and husband, even if he can be ignorant or oblivious to his family's feelings and ideas. When he thinks he's let anyone he loves down, it really does affect him, and in the end, will do anything for them.</p>

                <h3>Marjorie Jacqueline Simpson (n√©e Bouvier)</h3>
                <p>She is generally a very kind-hearted and loving woman. In contrast to her husband and son, Marge hardly ever swears and, except on occasional incidents, puts greater effort into controlling her temper. Despite this, she can be protective of her family when she needs to, especially during Homer's "psychopath" moments. However, she cares deeply about everyone she's closest too as well, even her husband. On occasion, she can sometimes get explosive outbursts of anger, but admits her errors and apologizes right after - in such incidents, she is primarily always forgiven but in others, she doesn't.</p>

            <div class="panel" style="background-image: url(../Index/src-d1/LeMagg.png)">
                <h3>Margaret Evelyn Lenny Simpson</h3>
                <p>Despite being the only member of the Simpson family who hasn't actually learned how to speak, Maggie is in no way one-dimensional and has different personality layers. She appears to be somewhat detached from the rest of her family and is once described as "the forgotten Simpson" by Homer. Maggie shows a stronger devotion to her mother than her father, possibly because Marge is always at home or shopping with her while Homer is mostly at work or Moe's Tavern.</p>
